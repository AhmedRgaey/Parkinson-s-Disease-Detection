## :writing_hand: Project Description:
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. 
Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. 
Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.
In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. 
Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.
Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. 
Occasionally, your health care provider may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.
So i decided to build a model that's detect Parkinson's disease.

## :innocent: Motivation
We must discover the disease in its first stage to eliminate it easily and treat it.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here [Click to Download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thecansin/parkinsons-data-set)

## :mag: Data contents
This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from
31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a
particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice
recording from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data
is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status"
column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.

The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an
instance corresponding to one voice recording. There are around six
recordings per patient, the name of the patient is identified in the first
column.

## :clap: Result
Model gave 94% accuracy for Parkinson's Disease Detection using Random Forest Classifier.
